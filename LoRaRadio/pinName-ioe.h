/**@file pinName-ioe.h
 * This file was intended to specify all of the SX1509 (I2C) IO Extension
 * pin names, when you are using the extension chip. Since the LoRaBug
 * does not make use of the SX1509 to communicate with the SX1276 radio,
 * we omit these labels.
 * These are used in the definition of the PinName enum in \a board.h
